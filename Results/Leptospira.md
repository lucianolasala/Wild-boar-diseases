#### Legend for figure: Distribution of cases of Leptospira sp. in wild boar from southwest Buenos Aires province. Circles represent locations with one (white), two (green) and frour (red) cases.        

>Distance data between cases-controls and nearest farm were not normally distributed.   
>Test for normality:    
- H0 = dist. is normal  
- H1 = dist. is not normal   
- If p > 0.05 cannot reject H0    
>In our case, p-value = 1.75e-11 means that we need to reject H0 and accept H1.
