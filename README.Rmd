Introduction
----------  
This repository contains the R scripts and details of methods employed for the development of an ecological niche model (henceforth ENM) for Wild boar (*Sus scrofa*) in Argentina.

A Maximum Entropy approach (https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/) method was used inside the R programing environment (https://www.r-project.org/). The repository also aims to serve as a document for the methodology.  Rather than having everything in a single script, the code is divided in a series of separate scripts that should be run sequentially.
